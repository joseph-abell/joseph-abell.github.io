# React

React is diffing tool pretending to be a UI library. It creates snapshots of application state, compares them, and decides which
parts of the ui needs to re-render. It is usually best practice to not get in React's way while doing so, because unless you have
a stupidly complex element tree, or your elements are doing something very complex, it's usually quicker to allow the excess
rerenders than checking manually.

## JSX

React introduced JSX. We can think of it as an extension to JS, that provides a HTML like syntax. It compiles down to an object that
represents an element. A simplified version of what it compiles to is below:

```JS
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

## Updating elements

Most of the time, react apps will call the root component's render method once. The updates to the app will be driven by state updates.

```JS

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Clock = () => {
  const initialDate = new Date();
  const [date, setDate] = useState(initialDate.toLocaleTimeString());

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeId = setInterval(() => {
      const t = new Date();
      setDate(t.toLocaleTimeString());
    }, 1000);

    return (() => {
      clearInterval(timeId);
    });
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {date}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```
