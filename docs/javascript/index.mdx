# Javascript

JS is a high level, swiss army knife of a language. It's almost never the
right language for the job, but it'll get you pretty damn close, and if you
are starting out, especially if you want to make websites, it's really hard
to argue against it's low barrier to entry, and relatively beginner friendly
nature.

It can be used everywhere. It can make websites, command line tools, applications,
and some less graphically intensive games. It's large ecosystem of third party code
can help prevent you from re-inventing the wheel. It has some pretty banger languages
that use it as a base, for example, Typescript.

Although I'm aware of a large chunk of idiosyncracies, and can find it to allow a
developer to shoot themselves in the foot in myriad ways, I have a fondness for JS.
It was the language that I learned in earnest, after a few attempts with Visual
Basic, C# .NET, and PHP. And it's kept food on my table for over a decade.

It's grown into a pretty versatile, if sometimes a little bloated, language.
