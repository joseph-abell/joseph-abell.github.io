# Types

Types are the building blocks that everything is created from.

- [Object][object] - The most primative type. A collection of named values. Everything is built on top of an object.
- [String][string] - A sequence of characters.
- [Number][number] - A number. Unlike other languages, JS has no seperation of different types of numbers.
  These can have a decimal, and they can be super long.
- [Boolean][boolean] - Named after [George Boole][boole]. A fancy name for Yes and No.
- [Array][array] - A list of values. Each value can be a different type to other values in the same array.
