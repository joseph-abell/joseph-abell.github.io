# Typescript

TS is a superset of JS. It is a way to add static type checking to JS. Unfortunately, it only provides type checking
at the point of compile, not at runtime. If you want to have type checking on runtime, you'll need something like ts-node,
which is a typescript environment for node. As a side note, just as you could type node to get a JS environment in the command
line, you can run npx ts-node for a typescript environment for futzing around.

## Everyday types

### String

```TS
const s: string = 'foo';
const t = 'bar'; // Takes string as the type implicitly
```

### Number

```TS
const a: number = 123;
const b = 123;
```

### Boolean

```TS
const a: boolean = true;
const b = false;
```

### Arrays

TS really does like it if you only put one type inside an array - it finds it much harder to track types when you can have options.

```TS
const a: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const b: Array<string> = ['hi', 'hello', 'hey'];
```

### Any

If you are having a truly troublesome typing session, any can be your friend. Usually, this is saved for the truly nightmare scenarios,
otherwise why are you bothering using TS?

```TS
const a: Array<any> = [1, 'a', true]; 
```

### BigInt

```TS
const a: bigint = 100n;
```

### Symbol

```TS
const a: symbol = Symbol();
```

## Adding types to a function

```TS
const foo = (
  bar: string, // typing the bar parameter
  baz: string // typing the bax parameter
): number => // typing the return value
  ((foo + bar).length);

// Written as one line
const foo = (bar: string, baz: string): number => ((bar + baz).length);

// The nice thing though is that implicit types can be applied here

// no need for return type as it is obvious from the parameter types
const foo = (bar: string, baz: string) => (foo + bar).length; 
``` 

## Union types

Think of union types as a way to say a variable can be one of multiple types

```TS
const a = 10;
const b: string | num = a < 5 ? 0 : 'foo';
```

Make sure that if you have a union type, do some more type checking on the
runtime. You don't want to be doing a toLowerCase on a number type, as it
does not exist and will cause an error.

## Object types

```TS
type Vector = {x: string, y: string};

const addVector = (vec1: Vector, vec2: Vector): Vector => ({
  x: vec1.x + vec2.x,
  y: vec1.y + vec2.y
});
```

You can extend types by doing the following:

```TS
type Vector = { x: string, y: string };
type Vector3 = Vector & { z: string };
```


## Interfaces

Interfaces are very similar to object types above, expect that you can extend interfaces.

```TS

interface Vector {
  x: string;
  y: string;
}

interface Vector3 extends Vector {
  z: string;
}
```

You can add values to an interface on the fly, unlike object types. Not sure why you would, but you can:

```TS
interface Window {
  title: string
}

interface Window {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI
}

const src = 'const a = "Hello World"';
window.ts.transpileModule(src, {});
```

## Type Assertions

If you truly want to be naughty, you can tell typescript that a variable should actually be a specific type.

```TS
const a = 'hi' as string;
const b = 'hi' as number; // NEVER lie to typescript. It's like you like bugs.
const c: string = 'hi'; // It's always more preferable to define types up front. Assertions are a good way to introduce bugs.
```

## Optional values

```TS
let a?: string;
a = 'hi';
```

## Enums

As a general rule, don't use Enums as they actually change the JS code. We prefer it when TS can give us type safety without
changing the code under the hood.
