# Docs

This documentation is a learning and memory aid, primarily for one person, Joseph Abell.
I'd strongly recommend any and every developer doing something similar. If anything,
to collect references to cool and interesting blog posts that other people have written,
so you can find them at a later time. I lost a wonderful resource on functional programming once,
and I'm still kicking myself that I can't find it again.

Everything here is written to be a succinct as I can. The posts should be
understandable to any junior developer, but they should be quick hits of info. For
further reading, checkout out the credits at the bottom of each page. All examples are
in an immutable format, meaning that data doesn't change after creation. This is a tradeoff
between removing potential hard to spot bugs, and increasing the size of your app. For me,
less bugs is a good thing.

If this is of use to you, amazing. Just keep in mind that you are not really the
intended audience for these posts. That audience is me, and me alone.
