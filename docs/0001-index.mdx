# JoeDB

This collection of notes acts as a learning and memory aid, primarily for one person, Joe Abell.
Any and every developer should do something similar. Having a collection of summaries, references 
and interesting blog posts that other people have written is a massive boon to productivity. 

I once lost a wonderful resource on functional programming once, and I'm still 
kicking myself that I can't find it again.

Everything here is written to be as succinct as possible. The posts should be
understandable to junior developers, but they should be quick hits of info. For
further reading, check out out the credits at the bottom of each page. Any examples
will be written in an immutable format. This means that data doesn't change after point of creation.
This is a tradeoff between removing potential hard to spot bugs, and increasing the size of your app. For me,
less bugs is a good thing.

If this is of use to you, amazing. Just keep in mind that you are not really the
intended audience for these posts. That audience is me, and me alone.
