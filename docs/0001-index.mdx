# JoeDB

This collection of notes acts as a learning and memory aid, primarily for one person, Joe Abell, me, hi.
In my opinion, any and every developer should do something similar. Having a collection of summaries,
references and interesting blog posts that other people have written is a massive boon to my working memory. 
I once lost a wonderful resource on functional programming once, and I'm still 
kicking myself that I can't find it again.

Everything here is written to be as short as possible. The posts should be understandable to junior
developers, but they should be quick hits of info. For further reading, check out out the credits at
the bottom of each page. Any examples will be written in an immutable format. This means that data
doesn't change after point of creation. This is a tradeoff between removing potential hard to spot
bugs, and increasing the size of your app. For me, less bugs is a good thing.

If this is of use to you, amazing. Glad to be of service. If you find yourself asking a question of how do
you do something, and I don't have a solution, let me know. We can add it to the list together.
