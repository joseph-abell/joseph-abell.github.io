# Functions

A function is a set of statements that can optionally output a value. They are one of the basic building blocks of
programming, and can act as a way to order your logic, and keep related thoughts together.

Let's start with an old school function declaration:

## Function Declaration

```JS
function double(num) {
  return num + num;
}
```

We can break this down into three parts:
- The name of the function - double
- Parameters being passed into the function - in this case it is `num`, but it can be as many or as little as we would like.
- The JS statements that are the logic which will run when the function is called. In this case, 
we only have one statement, `return num + num;`

To actually use the function, you call it, like so:

```JS
double(2); // we should get 4 back
```

We call it by referencing the name and passing it the parameters it expects in curly brackets.

Note that you can pass the function with no values, and Javascript absolutely does not care:

```JS
double(); // returns a special value called NaN
```

We recieve NaN, which stands for not a number, because if you try to multiple the idea of nothing
with itself, it isn't technically a number.

## Default values

You could make this return zero when passed no parameter by rewriting the function as such:

```JS
function double(num = 0) {
  return num + num;
}
```

We have given the num parameter a default value. This means that when you don't pass in a value, we set the value to 0.
0 plus 0 is 0, so we are good to go. Except: Our code is still a little bit naive. What do you think it will do if we pass it
a string, rather than a number?

```JS
double("2");
```

It returns 22. Which although looks odd, but is because adding strings together to join them is perfectly valid.

```JS
double("yum"); // returns yumyum
```

So, if we want this to only work with numbers, you'll need some type checking:

```JS
function double(num = 0) {
  const n = Number(num);

  return n + n;
}

double("2"); // 4
```

We could shorten this a little bit more by moving the type checking into the return:

```JS
function double(num) {
  return Number(num) + Number(num);
}

double("2"); // 4
```

Now when passed a string representation of a number, our code would do as we expect. If we were passed a word,
we would get NaN returned. 

Note that we had to duplicate the type check for both num uses, as we have removed the variable that did this
for us. If we only did it once, we would get a bug:

```JS
function double(num) {
  return Number(num) + num; // the second num could still be a string
}

double("2") // comes out at 22 again.
```

It returns as 22 because if you try to add a string and a number together, the number is turned into a string,
and they are added together as two strings. This process of converting a value from one type to another is called
type casting, and it happens all the damn time in JS if you don't be careful.

## Arrow functions

Here is the code as a regular old function declaration:

```JS
function double(num) {
  return Number(num) + Number(num);
}
```

Let's rewrite the code as an arrow function.

```JS
const double = (num) => {
  return Number(num) + Number(num);
}
```

There are some subtle differences between the function declaration style and arrow functions. Let's ignore them.
We still have the three sections as before. We have the name of the function, which in this case is the variable name.
We still have the parameters being passed into the function via the curly brackets. And we still have our statements the function
will run, inside the moustache brackets. But, because this is a very simple, one line function with only one parameter,
we can make it even simpler.

Let's start with implicit returns.

## Implicit returns

In the code below, focus on the return statement inside the middle line of the function:

```JS
const double = (num) => {
  return Number(num) + Number(num);
}
```

Can you see we have the word return? Because this is a function with a single statement, 
we can remove it entirely. Along with the moustache brackets, why not.

```JS
const double = (num) =>
  Number(num) + Number(num);

```

You can even make this one line:

```JS
const double = (num) => Number(num) + Number(num);
```

Because there is only one statement, and we don't wrap it in moustache brackets, the arrow function runs that code and implicitly returns it's result.

But wait, because we only have one parameter, and we are not adding types to the function like you might wish to in Typescript, you can make this even smaller:

```JS
const double = num => Number(num) + Number(num);
```

Each and every one of these functions will do the same thing. It's a matter of taste as to what style to use. Odds are though, you'll
probably be sticking with arrow functions as much as possible, due to those previously mentioned subtle differences. If you want to
know more, read [MDN's article on the word `this`][this], and good luck, it's a whole can of worms you probably don't need to know just yet.
