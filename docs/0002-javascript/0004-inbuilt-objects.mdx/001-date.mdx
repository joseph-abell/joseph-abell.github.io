# Date

Date was created at the very early stages of JS, and was cribbed basically wholesale from Java's date implementation.
The downside is that Java implementers realised super early that what they had made was utter horseshit, and wrote
a replacement API. JS stuck with this implementation for about 20 years.

Needless to say we are all waiting for the Temporal API. 

## Get the current date

```JS
const a = new Date(); // returns the date object, but is shown in a YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.msZ format to consoles.
a.toString() // Gives us in a human readable format, including the timezone.
a.getTime() // Gives a numeric representation of the date, in ms since 1st jan 1970

const b = Date.now() // returnsa numeric value of the date, in milliseconds since 1st Jan 1970
```

The following examples were cribbed directly from MDN

```JS
const today = new Date()
const birthday = new Date('December 17, 1995 03:24:00') // DISCOURAGED: may not work in all runtimes
const birthday2 = new Date('1995-12-17T03:24:00')   // This is ISO8601-compliant and will work reliably
const birthday3 = new Date(1995, 11, 17)            // the month is 0-indexed
const birthday4 = new Date(1995, 11, 17, 3, 24, 0)
const birthday5 = new Date(628021800000)            // passing epoch timestamp
```

## Get the day of the week

```JS
const a = new Date();
a.getDay(); // returns 0 - 6, 0 being sunday, 1 monday and so on.
```

## Get the day of the month

```JS
const a = new Date();
a.getMonth(); // returns the day of the month
```

## Get the month

```JS
const a = new Date();
a.getMonth(); // returns 0 - 11, 0 being Jan and so on.
```

## Get the full year

```JS
const a = new Date();
a.getFullYear(); // 4 digit year
```

## Get the date in a human readable format

```JS
const a new Date();
a.toDateString(); // Wed Aug 17 2022
a.toUTCString(); // Wed, 17 Aug 2022 21:58:23 GMT
a.toLocaleString(); // 17/08/2022, 22:58:23
a.toLocaleTimeString(); // 22:58:23
```
