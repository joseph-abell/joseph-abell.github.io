# Undefined

Undefined is the default state for a variable, before you define a value.
It is the value you need, when you are unintentionally setting
a value to empty. It could be you set a variable to undefined just before 
you set the value after an async call, or after some computation.

Ultimately, I rarely set values explicitly to undefined. Usually the setting
is implicit, if at all.

## Create

```JS
const a; // undefined
const b = undefined; // undefined
```

## check if a value is undefined

```JS
const a = undefined;

if (a === undefined) a; // undefined
```

## Check if a value is defined

```JS
const a;

a?.b; // will bomb out at the point of seeing a is undefined, but will not throw an error.

const b = {
  c: {
    d: 'd'
  }
}

b?.c?.d; // 'd'
b?.e; // undefined
```
