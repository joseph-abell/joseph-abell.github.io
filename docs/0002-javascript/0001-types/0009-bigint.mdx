# BigInt

BigInts are numbers that were previously too large to fit into Number. They lose the ability to have decimals,
and they don't like doing mathematics mixed with Number variables. they cannot be used with the built in Math
object. You can still do operations on them however.

I've not knowingly used these in my career.

## Create

```JS
const a = 123n; // BigInt 123
```
