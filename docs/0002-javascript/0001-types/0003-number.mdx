# Number

Most programming languages have a lot of different ways to represent numbers. JS has just two.
BigInt, which is for mindbogglingly large numbers, and Number, which handles everything else.

Numbers can handle decimal places, and they can handle negative numbers. They are technically
double precision, 64 bit binary format, if you care. If you really care, here are the [specs][specs].

JS is not the most precise mathematical tool. In fact, in some cases, it's just plainly wrong.
Check out what it gives you when you do 0.1 + 0.2. It is not the right answer.

## Creation

```JS
const a = 123.0; // 123
const b = 123; // 123
const c = Number('123'); // 123
const d = Number('not a number') // NaN
const e = Number(undefined) // NaN
const f = Number() // 0
```

## Comparison

```JS
const a = 123.0;
const b = 123;

a === b; // true
```
